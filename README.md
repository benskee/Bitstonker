## About The Project

This is a portfolio project that allows the user to analyze stocks denominated in Bitcoin. As a bonus I built the stonk-by-stonk feature that allows the user to compare 2 stocks. This project can be found at [bitstonker.com](bitstonker.com)


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/benskee/Bitstonker.git
    ```

2. Create your virtual environment. (If you need help with virtual environments visit [this tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv bitstonker-env
    ```

3. Activate your virtual environment

    Windows 

    ```
    bitstonker-env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    Unix or Mac 
    ```sh 
    source bitstonker-env/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the packages from requirements.txt 
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Activate Sample Database

In [/app/routes.py](/app/routes.py) find ([this function](https://github.com/benskee/Bitstonker/blob/55e713d70fc8fd5f1844e23f8a2eefeeed82247d/app/routes.py#L53)) 

```
df_btc = create_df_btc()
```

Replace with 

```
df_btc = create_sample_df_btc()
```

This will run the app using the included sample_btc.csv in place of the btc database. 
If you would like to generate your own Bitcoin csv you can visit [This Repo](https://github.com/benskee/Bitcoin_stock_hours)



## Activate Stonks
For the stonks you can either:

### 1) Use an API KEY
Use an api key from alphavantage.com. If you would like to obtain a free one follow this
link. [https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support#api-key)

To use your api key change the `SECRET_KEY` variable in `config.py` 
    
```
SECRET_KEY = 'your alphavantage api key'
```
### 2) Use Sample CSV Files
If you do not want to use an API key you can use the sample csv files. 
In [/app/routes.py](/app/routes.py) find the function 
```
get_stonk_df() 
```

replace with 

```
get_sample_stonk_df()  
```

There are 3 occurances: the first is for the main page and can be found [here](https://github.com/benskee/Bitstonker/blob/55e713d70fc8fd5f1844e23f8a2eefeeed82247d/app/routes.py#L49).
The other two are for the stonk-by-stonk page and can be found [here](https://github.com/benskee/Bitstonker/blob/55e713d70fc8fd5f1844e23f8a2eefeeed82247d/app/routes.py#L106-L110).

For this option you will not have access to the api and will be limited to the sample tickers 
(GBTC, TSLA, AMZN, SPY, COKE, PEP).

## Run the App
The last step is to activate flask on your local host 
```
flask run
``` 


**Happy stonking!**
