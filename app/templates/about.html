        <b>What is bitcoin?</b> <br>
        Bitcoin is a decentralized permissionless global cryptocurrency that runs on a blockchain. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't feel bad
        because most people still don't get it. If you would like to learn more about bitcoin, Peter McCormack made a great beginner's guide
        on his What Bitcoin Did podcast. <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/bitcoin-in-one-lesson">What Bitcoin Did: Bitcoin in One Lesson</a>
        (duration 1hr). If you are feeling more ambitious <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">
        The Bitcoin Standard</a> by Saifedean Ammous will give you a good foundational knowledge of bitcoin. <br>

        <b>What is a stonk?</b> <br>
        A stonk is a meme used to poke fun at poor investments. This term has grown in popularity in the 2020's as the stock
        market has continued to rise despite major changes in demand due to the Covid19 pandemic.

        <b>How was daily price in bitcoin calculated?</b> <br>
        The daily price was calculated using data for the price of bitcoin at 4pm each day to match the time for the closing price of stonk.
        The historic prices were taken from the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a> exchange and is kept current via data from 
        <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alphavantage</a>. The dates are limited to the beginning of 2016 until today. 
        Sorry, I do not have future dates. If that changes I will be sure to update this from my private island.<br><br>
